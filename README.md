This is a repository for tracking and managing liaisons with Minnesota Counties. 
It's made with a basic Leaflet (leafletjs.com) map and a geojson file.
HAS: County overlay with popup displaying county name, MnGeo contact, and status.
NEEDS: New status definitions, and edits to status in geojson.

Demo available for testing only here: http://rawgit.com/mmdolbow/mncounty-tracking/master/map.html
